Testing plan

Requirement:
1. Linux (tested with Ubuntu 16.02)
2. ROS environment 
3. SICK scanner with Ethernet connection
4. Checked out and built ROS repo

Proposed Test Sequence

1. Switch on the scanner
2. To check or modify your current launch file, open it with your preferred editor.
3. Check scanner IP address availability: ping aa.bb.cc.dd
    Example for use in the local network: ping 192.168.0.2
4. If the scanner is pingable, set the correct Linux environment for ROS:
    a) Change to the ROS-workspace directory:
        cd <ws>
        For example: cd ~/catkin_ws
    b) Start setup script to set up the ROS environment:
        Input: source ./devel/setup.bash
5. Start ROS nodes of the selected scanner type:
    Command: roslaunch sick_scan <id> .launch
    The following scanner types are currently supported:
    MRS1104
    TiM 571
    The launch files are named as follows:
    sick_tim_5xx.launch for TiM571
    sick_mrs_1xxx.launch for MRS1104
    Example (will be used in the following).
    roslaunch sick_scan mrs_1xxx.launch

6. To check the node at the console level, the following tests are performed in another terminal window:
a) rosparam list [ENTER]: output all ROS parameters
b) rosparam list /sick_mrs_1xxx/* Output of the parameters for the MRS1104
c) rosparam get /sick_mrs_1xxx/ |tr ',' '\n' prints the values of the parameter set
d) rostopic hz /scan: Check the scan rate output rate
e) rostopic hz /cloud: Check the Pointcloud2 output rate

7. Check the multi-target ability:
    a) Cancel roslaunch with CTRL-C (or alternatively with kill <process>)
	b) Get the BIT mask for the goals:
       Example: rosparam get / mrs_1xxx / active_echos
    b) Set the BIT mask for the goals:
	c) rosparam set /mrs_1xxx 7 (bit encoded distance settings: DIST1, DIST2, DIST3)	
c) Check the scan rate for the scan output
rostopic hz /scan (must be 50 Hz * (number of echo targets set))

Repeat steps a) to d) for the following
BIT masks: 1, 4, 2, 3

8. Check the Pointcloud2 output:
    a) Start visualization tool from ROS:
       rosrun rviz rviz

    b) Subscribe to scan messages via the following steps (see also Chapter 4 at: http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide)
       Add -> Laserscan
	   Add -> Pointcloud2

    c) Check the visualization
	
9. Angle specification:
The angle range can also be set via min_ang and max_ang.
The setting is in radians. The test follows the logic above. Recommended angle range test: +/- 45 Â°:
min_ang: -0.785398
max_ang: +0.785398

Check.: The representation in rviz must then be limited to this angle area.

Remarks for setting parameters for echo_filter and active_echo

Regarding to the SOPAS documentation filtering of multi echo can be set by a echo filter or by using the configuration command.

The specific SOPAS command are:
multi_echo corresponds to "sWN LMDscandatacfg"
echo_filter correspons to "sWN FREchoFilter".

The combination of this settings can yield a configuration with no active echoes. These settings are handled by the node driver in the following way
for the point cloud messages:

No actives echoes: The software sends the nearest target information (fallback solution to avoid "empty" point clouds).
In other cases, the handling is done by a boolean "AND"-operation. E.g. echo_filter=1 and active_echo=3 gives the following result:

active_echos (3):     0 1 1 
echo_filter (1) : &   1 1 1
                     ======
                      0 1 1   (two echos)

Example for "empty" echo:

active_echos (4):     1 0 0 
echo_filter (2) : &   0 0 1 (nearest)
                     ======
                      0 0 0 (no echos)  --> Fallback to one echo (see above)
